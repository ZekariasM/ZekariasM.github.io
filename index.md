The **R** **E**pidemics **Con**sortium (RECON) assembles a group of
international experts in infectious disease modelling, Public Health, and
software development to create the **next generation of tools for disease
outbreak analysis** using the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/).

This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and
analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more
general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system
infrastructure.

Our packages must fulfil three key aspects:

- *Efficiency*: our tools can be used in real time to improve situation awareness and inform intervention strategies.

- *Reliability*: our tools are thoroughly and constantly tested using professional software development methods.

- *Accessibility*: our tools are free, open-source, and available on virtually any platform; they can be used with different levels of expertise, and provide graphical user interfaces implementing the most important functionalities.

Besides its active involvement in the creation of tools, RECON is also increasingly dedicated to:

- *disseminating knowledge*: RECON is developing a new training platform, and a
   series of workshops and short courses on epidemics analysis and outbreak
   response. Our [public forum ](/forum) is also dedicated to sharing exptertise
   on these topics.

- *outbreak response deployment*: RECON supports the deployment of data analysts
   to the field as part of outbreak response teams; this includes the deployment
   of staff as well as analysis systems adapted to low resources settings.
